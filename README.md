## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

This is my first project and attempt at putting what I've been learning into practice. I learned how to visualize my own flow of beginning a project from just a blank body. The most challenging and rewarding part was having the image overlay on the picture of the NFT when hovering over. My answer to that is this snippet of HTML.

```html
<div class="nft-card-image">
      <img src="images/image-equilibrium.jpg" alt="Equilibrium picture">
      <a href="#" class="overlay"></a>
    </div>
```

### Continued development

I want to continue focusing on learning usage of flexbox and positioning on HTML elements. I haven't been able to grasp their importance until I was able to use them in this project.

### Useful resources

- [W3 Image Hover Overlay](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_image_overlay.asp) - This is what helped me understand how to achieve the image hover overlay effect I needed.
